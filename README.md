# Automated Theory Construction

This repository aims to start from a small set of axioms and automatically build up a growing collection of derived theorems.

The longer-term goal is more ambitious than simply producing many theorems: the system should push toward statements in the most general form it can discover, move beyond the current internal language when needed, and remain usable even for niche axiom systems that are not already well-tooled or neatly standardized.

Here, "moving beyond the internal language" means not stopping at equations built only from the primitive operation and variables, but also searching for statements about existence, nonexistence, uniqueness, finite-model behavior, cardinality bounds, and other global constraints on the models of the axioms.

In other words, this repository is aimed at exploratory theorem generation in underdeveloped formal settings, not only automation inside familiar, well-prepared theories.

It implements an automated theory-construction loop on top of Lean 4 + Mathlib. Given a base theory, the system proposes candidate statements, attempts to formalize and prove them in Lean, verifies successful results, and accumulates the verified theorems into the derived theory.

## Most Important Principle

The most important part of this repository is the solved-and-verified follow-up policy in `prompts/new_problem_expander.md`.

If you read only one design rule, read this one: when the current problem is solved and verified (`verify_success = true` and `result = proof|counterexample`), the system should prefer outward-looking follow-up problems that extend the theory rather than merely staying near the last proof script.

More concretely, follow-up generation should favor, roughly in this order:

1. natural generalizations or reusable abstractions
2. converses, strict separations, or failure-of-converse statements
3. existence, uniqueness, impossibility, or rigidity phenomena
4. finite-model behavior, extremal behavior, boundary cases, or classification fragments
5. adjacent structural consequences that clarify the global shape of the theory

At least one candidate should ideally broaden, reinterpret, or reuse the verified result beyond the immediate local target. Prefer candidates that teach something non-obvious about the theory or its models. If a more informative model-level, structural, or boundary-case follow-up is available, prefer it over a nearby local rewrite.

## Quick Mental Model

```text
[Theory.lean]
  base symbols + axioms
        ↓
[scripts/run_loop.py]
  generate / formalize / prove / repair
        ↓
[Scratch.lean]
  temporary Lean verification
        ↓
[Derived.lean]
  accumulated verified theorems
```

## Illustrative Results

These are representative examples from the current repository state. They are intentionally cherry-picked to show the kind of output the loop can already produce, not to claim broad coverage or maturity yet.

Starting from the three axioms of `SemigroupLike01`, the system has automatically derived nontrivial universal consequences such as:

```lean
∀ {α : Type u} [SemigroupLike01 α], ∀ x y : α, (x * y) * x = x * y
```

and

```lean
∀ {α : Type _} [SemigroupLike01 α], ∀ e : α,
  (∀ x : α, x * e = e) → ∀ x : α, e * x = e
```

It has also produced stronger derived identities, for example:

```lean
∀ {α : Type u} [SemigroupLike01 α], ∀ x y z : α,
  (x * y) * (x * z) = (x * y) * z
```

The system does not only accumulate positive laws. It can also reject tempting but false universal conjectures by constructing explicit finite countermodels. For example, it verified a 3-element model satisfying the three axioms while failing associativity, so:

```lean
¬(∀ {α : Type u} [SemigroupLike01 α], ∀ x y z : α, (x * y) * z = x * (y * z))
```

is accompanied by a certified concrete witness rather than only a failed proof search.

Just as importantly, the long-term direction is not limited to equational reasoning inside the operation language itself. The project is meant to move outward toward statements involving external structure, such as existence, finiteness, cardinality, and model-level constraints. In that sense, the goal is not only to derive more identities, but to discover when a sparse axiom system starts forcing global facts about the kinds of models it can or cannot have.

For a first-time reader, the core idea is:

- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Theory.lean` defines the starting symbols and axioms
- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean` is the temporary file used for Lean verification
- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Derived.lean` stores the verified theorems discovered so far
- `scripts/run_loop.py` orchestrates the full loop

The current design is a single runtime pipeline with:

- deterministic orchestration in Python
- Lean verification through `Scratch.lean`
- verified theorem accumulation in `Derived.lean`
- worker-driven stages for statement formalization, proving, formalization/repair, and expansion

## Current Runtime Design

The main loop is `scripts/run_loop.py`. Its runtime paths are currently fixed in code:

- theory: `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Theory.lean`
- accumulated theorems: `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Derived.lean`
- temporary verification file: `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean`
- initial seeds: `theories/semigroup_like_01/seeds.jsonl`
- runtime state: `data/`

So the current implementation is not yet a generic multi-theory runner. To change the active theory, edit those fixed files rather than expecting a theory selector CLI.

Each iteration runs the following stages:

1. Pick the next open problem deterministically.
2. If the problem is not already Lean-formal, try `prover_statement` to turn it into a Lean-ready statement.
3. Run `prover` to choose `proof`, `counterexample`, or `stuck`.
4. Run `formalize`, then `lake env lean AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean`.
5. If verification fails, run `repair` until the retry budget is exhausted.
6. If verification succeeds, append the theorem body from `Scratch.lean` into `Derived.lean`.
7. Run `expand` to suggest additional problems.
8. Apply deterministic state updates to `open`, `solved`, and `counterexamples`.

Open problems may be either Lean-formal statements or semi-formal research prompts. If a problem cannot be formalized, it stays open.

## Repository Layout

- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Theory.lean`: base theory, symbols, and axioms
- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Derived.lean`: verified theorem accumulation target
- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean`: temporary verification artifact
- `scripts/run_loop.py`: main orchestrator
- `scripts/codex_worker.py`: worker wrapper around `codex exec`
- `scripts/mock_worker.py`: contract-compatible mock worker
- `scripts/worker_client.py`: subprocess worker client and timeout handling
- `scripts/lean_verify.py`: Lean verification wrapper
- `scripts/state_update.py`: deterministic JSONL state transitions
- `scripts/append_derived.py`: append verified theorems to `Derived.lean`
- `prompts/prover_statement_formalizer.md`: statement-formalization prompt
- `prompts/prover_simple.md`: prover prompt
- `prompts/formalizer_simple.md`: formalize/repair prompt
- `prompts/new_problem_expander.md`: expansion prompt
- `theories/semigroup_like_01/seeds.jsonl`: currently active seed queue
- `example/*`: reference examples not wired into `run_loop.py`

## Requirements

- Lean toolchain from `lean-toolchain`
- Lake + Mathlib dependencies
- Python
- `uv`
- Codex CLI if you want to use `scripts/codex_worker.py`

For interactive Lean work with Codex, `lean-lsp-mcp` is also useful, but it is not part of the runtime loop itself.

## Setup

Build the Lean project once:

```bash
lake build
```

Smoke-check the verification path:

```bash
lake env lean AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean
```

## Quick Start

Edit the active theory:

- `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Theory.lean`
- `theories/semigroup_like_01/seeds.jsonl`

Then choose a worker mode.

### Dry Run With Mock Worker

This exercises the loop and state transitions without calling Codex:

```bash
ATC_WORKER_COMMAND="uv run scripts/mock_worker.py" \
uv run scripts/run_loop.py --enable-worker
```

### Run With Codex Worker

```bash
ATC_WORKER_COMMAND="uv run scripts/codex_worker.py" \
ATC_WORKER_TIMEOUT=420 \
ATC_CODEX_TIMEOUT=390 \
uv run scripts/run_loop.py --enable-worker
```

## Initialization Behavior

By default, `scripts/run_loop.py` starts with `--initialize-on-start`, which means it will:

- overwrite `data/open_problems.jsonl` from `theories/semigroup_like_01/seeds.jsonl`
- reset `data/solved_problems.jsonl`
- reset `data/counterexamples.jsonl`
- reset `data/formalization_memory.json`
- reset `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean`
- reset `AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Derived.lean`
- run `lake build`

If you want to continue from the current runtime state and keep accumulated theorems in `Derived.lean`, use:

```bash
ATC_WORKER_COMMAND="uv run scripts/codex_worker.py" \
ATC_WORKER_TIMEOUT=420 \
ATC_CODEX_TIMEOUT=390 \
uv run scripts/run_loop.py --enable-worker --no-initialize-on-start
```

This reset behavior is important: the current loop treats initialization as "start a fresh run from seeds".

## Worker Configuration

Shared worker settings:

- `ATC_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `ATC_WORKER_TIMEOUT`

Task-specific overrides:

- `ATC_PROVER_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `ATC_PROVER_WORKER_TIMEOUT`
- `ATC_PROVER_STATEMENT_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `ATC_PROVER_STATEMENT_WORKER_TIMEOUT`
- `ATC_FORMALIZE_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `ATC_FORMALIZE_WORKER_TIMEOUT`
- `ATC_REPAIR_WORKER_COMMAND`
- `ATC_REPAIR_WORKER_TIMEOUT`

Useful Codex worker settings:

- `ATC_CODEX_TIMEOUT`: inner timeout used by `scripts/codex_worker.py`
- `ATC_CODEX_MODEL`: optional model override for `codex exec`
- `ATC_PROVER_CODEX_MODEL`: optional prover-only model override
- `ATC_PROVER_CODEX_TIMEOUT`: optional prover-only inner timeout override
- `ATC_PROVER_STATEMENT_CODEX_MODEL`: optional prover-statement-only model override
- `ATC_PROVER_STATEMENT_CODEX_TIMEOUT`: optional prover-statement-only inner timeout override

You can also override the same settings through CLI flags such as:

- `--worker-command`
- `--worker-timeout`
- `--prover-worker-command`
- `--prover-worker-timeout`
- `--prover-statement-worker-command`
- `--prover-statement-worker-timeout`
- `--formalize-worker-command`
- `--formalize-worker-timeout`
- `--repair-worker-command`
- `--repair-worker-timeout`

## Runtime Artifacts

The loop stores its state in `data/`:

- `data/open_problems.jsonl`
- `data/solved_problems.jsonl`
- `data/counterexamples.jsonl`
- `data/formalization_memory.json`

`data/formalization_memory.json` stores same-problem history across statement formalization, formalization, and repair attempts.

## Lean Module Contract

- `Theory.lean` defines the base objects and axioms.
- `Derived.lean` contains only verified theorems that have passed Lean checking.
- `Scratch.lean` is the temporary file used for each verification attempt.

The verification command is:

```bash
lake env lean AutomatedTheoryConstruction/Scratch.lean
```

## Notes

- `scripts/run_loop.py` currently assumes the semigroup-like seed file path and fixed module layout.
- `example/CCG`, `example/Equational_theory`, and `example/provability` are examples only; they are not selected by a runtime flag today.
- `expand` suggestions are deduplicated before state update.
- `formalize` and `repair` are separate task types, even if they use the same prompt file by default.
